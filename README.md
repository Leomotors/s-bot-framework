Guide Coming Soon! (*or may not come*)

## üìÉ Example

[Salim Bot](https://github.com/leomotors/salim-bot) is a great example!

## üåø Dependencies

- `libtool` to build @discordjs/opus

- ffmpeg

- nodejs 16.6.0+ (discordjs 13 requirement)

- Finally, a Discord Bot to runs on!

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitation

- This Framework is built for Salim Bot and should only applicable for bots that work similar way

- Salim Bot is designed to response to messages thus, Slash Command is not provided

- Badly written, Cannot handle more than one server at a time

- I'm lazy, gonna abandon this for a while

**Note**: These limitation is things that Salim Bot will never do, so never gonna be fixed.
